# Space Cat Breakthrough Game

Space Cat Breakthrough is an engaging and skill-testing game where the player controls a space cat with the goal of breaking through an array of colourful bricks while preventing the cat from falling below the paddle. The objective is to achieve the highest possible score. In this project, I have created an interactive game using P5.js, inspired by the iconic Atari game 'Breakout'.

### **Gameplay:**

- **Space Cat Control:** You control the space cat, guiding it with precision and agility. The cat bounces off the walls, and you must strategically position it to hit the bricks above.
- **Breaking Bricks:** The cat's mission is to break the bricks that are arranged in a matrix at the top of the screen. Each brick carries a point value, and breaking them increases your score.
- **Avoiding the Abyss:** The game introduces a challenging element; if the cat falls below the paddle, the game enters a "game over" state. Your mission is to ensure the cat stays above the paddle to keep playing.
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** The game's difficulty dynamically increases as you progress. The cat's speed and the complexity of brick arrangements keep you engaged and continuously challenged.

### **Visual Appeal**

"Space Cat Breakthrough" features an enticing space-themed background, accompanied by delightful graphics and animations.

### **Soundtrack**

The game incorporates a captivating background soundtrack to enhance the gaming experience.

### **Randomized Bricks**

The bricks come in a variety of colors, offering a visually appealing and dynamic game environment.

### **Controls:**

- **Left Arrow Key:** Move the space cat left.
